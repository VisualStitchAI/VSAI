# VisualStitch

VisualStitch is an AI-powered tool designed for crocheters and pattern creators. It helps recognize crochet elements from images and generates visual layouts and standard crochet diagrams from text prompts or photographs. This project is for both professionals and hobbyists seeking to bring their unique ideas to life through yarn and code.

## 💡 Core Features

- 📷 Upload a photo of a crocheted motif and get a diagram
- ✍️ Enter a text prompt and get a unique visual crochet design
- 🔁 Generate individual diagrams for each element (flower, leaf, cord, etc.)
- 🧶 Designed especially for Irish lace and complex freeform crochet
- 🧩 Connect inspiration and creation: from idea → visual → pattern

## 👥 Who is this for?

- Crafters who want to turn ideas into diagrams
- Designers creating patterns from scratch
- Tech-savvy crocheters
- AI + textile enthusiasts
